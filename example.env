# Database and api keys.
# Mongoose is required to run Phoenix. Redis might be required, not sure. If your bot is private, both of these databases are free to create through their websites.
# A Google api key is required to use the /youtube command. If you don't plan on using Youtube commands, you can remove the commands by deleting the file "commands/youtube.js".
